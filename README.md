WE MAKE AUTOPILOT SYSTEM for festival
We used small cars for child.
We have two cameras on frong. 
Head cam is used for tracking the line and lower one used for tracking car number.
Out System can tracks line of the load and then caculate the change of lanes.
Based on the changes we caculate steering angle and send it to servo motor. 
Caculating steering angle is based on MIT references.
